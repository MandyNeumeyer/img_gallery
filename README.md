usefull CSS properties for this exercise

```css
position: relative;
transform: rotate(deg);
transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function];
filter: grayscale(amount)
:hover
z-index
```
`position: relative`; element is positioned relative to its normal position.\
`transform` applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element\
`rotate()` method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise, depending on degrees setting\
`transitions` allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.\
`filter`property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element.\
`grayscale(amount)`converts the input image to grayscale. The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. A value of 100% is completely grayscale.\
`hover` triggered when the user hovers over an element\
`z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element.
